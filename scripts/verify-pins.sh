# Verify every action pin's `# vX.Y.Z` comment actually names the tag its SHA
# carries.
#
# This is the half of pin hygiene that needs the network, so it is NOT in the
# vitest suite (which must stay hermetic). src/ci-hygiene.test.ts enforces the
# offline half: every pin is a 40-hex SHA with an exact vX.Y.Z comment.
#
# Why it exists: a pin's comment can be silently false. Dependabot bumped
# actions/checkout to 3d3c42e — which is v7.0.1 — while leaving `# v6` on all
# five refs, and a stale `# v4` on gradle/actions/setup-gradle (really v4.4.3)
# had sat on main for months. Both read as fine. A wrong label is worse than no
# label: it makes a major-version jump look like a routine same-line bump.
#
# Read-only: git ls-remote only. No auth, no writes, no side effects.
